    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Moluxis</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by <strong>Ankush Sarkar</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
    <p>The Application does not require you to create an account or provide personal identifiers like your name or phone number. However, the Application may collect certain non-personal information automatically to function, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address (transmitted during network requests to fetch molecule data).</li>
        <li>The operating system and version used on your mobile device.</li>
        <li>Basic interactions within the app to improve the molecular visualization experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Application <strong>does not</strong> gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

    <strong>Third Party Access and APIs</strong>
    <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application. The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policies. Below are the links to the providers used by the Application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/web_policies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PubChem / NIH</a> (Used for fetching chemical data)</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider will retain automatically collected information for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. Since the Application does not collect "User Provided" personal data (like names or accounts), there is no personal profile data to delete.</p>

    <strong>Children's Privacy</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. If it is discovered that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete this.</p>

    <strong>Security</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information and provides electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the data processed. All network requests are made over encrypted (HTTPS) connections.</p>

    <strong>Changes</strong>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You are advised to consult this page regularly for any changes.</p>

    <p><em>Effective Date: February 6, 2026</em></p>
